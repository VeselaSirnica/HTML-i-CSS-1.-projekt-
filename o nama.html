 <h3>Why was there molten metal at 9/11 Ground Zero?</h3>

<p class="tekst">Neither steel nor any other metal melted on 9/11. 
    There is no EVIDENCE (videos or photos) of molten metal (that is liquid metal).
     Yes, there were accounts of metal/steel “flowing like lava” and videos show
    what seemed ignited material/sparks coming out of WTC 2 just before its
    destruction. However, especially witness testimony/accounts and video
    (much better of course) are the weakest kind of EVIDENCE.<br><br>
    Physical EVIDENCE is the best and most trustworthy testimony of WHAT
    happened on 9/11. It is impossible that anything, let alone concrete
    or metal, was “burning” under the debris for months. Yes, it is true 
     there are photos of glowing metal beams/pipes/cladding (steel and 
     aluminum), but not liquid metal, just glowing metal. However, everything
     that’s hot glows (over 600°C more or less), but not everything that glows
     is hot. Take for example a fluorescent light. Also rapid rusting of metal
     was observed on some cars and steel beams/pipes. Why? Some other physical 
      process not previously encountered was at work on 9/11. The molten metal
     story is just a myth. For example consider the reports of the workers
     steel-toed boots melting (no video EVIDENCE unfortunately).<br><br> I’m not say they 
    lied, I’m just saying that some other physical process must be introduced that
      can give the molten and glowing appearance to metal. After all there were no
     reports of burnt or, should we say, molten feet! If the steel in the boots 
      melted, how could the feet not be more than cooked!? How could the workers
     and rescue teams walk on the alleged hot rubble (supposedly heated by the
    fires/molten metal under the debris) without being grilled like on a BBQ?
     Consider all the water they poured on the rubble.<br><br> What looked like steam 
     rising from the debris, due to water turning to steam because of the 
     alleged heat, was in fact dust. The building remains, mainly steel and 
    concrete, have suffered some kind of molecular dissociation and continued
    tot do so for weeks/months. During the 1st year’s rembrance cerimony in 
    September 2002 the ground was still fuming with dust.

Please read some of my other answers on 9/11 below and be sure not to miss the comments as well (discussion, so to speak, with disinformation manager Mr. Fletcher) on all my answers (more than 20). They are based on the work and EVIDENCE presented by Dr. Judy Wood in her presentations and book “Where did the Towers Go? Evidence of Directed Free Energy Technology on 9/11.”
